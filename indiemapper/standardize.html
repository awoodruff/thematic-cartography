			<strong>To Standardize or Not?<br></strong>A very important consideration in thematic mapping is whether you want to present your data as <strong>raw counts / totals</strong> (e.g., the population of each country) or if you want to standardize your data to create <strong>rates / ratios</strong> (e.g., number of people in a each country <em>divided</em> by the area of that country = number of people per square mile/km). In this population example, the raw counts tell you how many people exist in each country, the ratio tells you how tightly packed-in those people are. One of the primary reasons to standardize your data is to allow your readers to compare places that are very different. For example, you can directly compare a large place (like Canada) with a smaller place (like Switzerland). Although Canada has more people than Switzerland, it has a far lower population density; without standardization, that fact might not be obvious.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want to make a <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=choropleth" target="_blank">choropleth map</a>, you MUST map only standardized data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bottom line: If you want your map readers to understand <em>magnitudes</em> (how much of something exists), use map totals/counts. If you want your map readers to understand <em>relative differences</em> (that account for things like size differences), use standardized data.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Are My Data Already Standardized?<br></strong>Theymight be!! If the numerical data you are about to map are listed as "<em>x per square mile/km/...</em>" or "<em>x per capita</em>" or "<em>percent</em>" or "<em>ratio of x / y</em>" then you can skip the data standardization step.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>How to Standardize Your Data<br></strong> The two most common ways to standardize our data are to divide the data by (1) <strong>the area of the enumeration units</strong>-creating "<em>x per square mile/km</em>" data-or (2) by <strong>the number of people within those places</strong>-creating "<em>x per capita</em>" or "<em>x as a % of the total population</em>" data.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the example below, I'm about to create an attribute map (step 1) that shows number of married couples by US county (step 2), as a choropleth map (step 3), using the area of the counties to standardize those data (step 4) to show the number of married couples per square mile. I could also have used the total population of those counties to calculate what percentage of people in different places are married. Both are good ways to standardize data like these.
