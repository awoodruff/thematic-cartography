			<strong>When to Use<br></strong>Bivariate proportional / graduated symbol maps combine two datasets (usually numerical data) into a single hybrid map symbol. They are very efficient because the size of the symbol tells you one thing and the color/fill tells you another. These maps exemplify the power of bivariate maps by allowing us to easily examine geographic relationship between two variables (like <em>income</em> and <em>education</em>). They inherit many of the strengths and weaknesses or univariate proportional symbol maps, outlined <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=proportional_symbols" target="_blank">here</a>. Like single-variable graduated symbol maps (in which the size and color of the symbol show the same data), an important decision here is whether or not to <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=classification" target="_blank">group your data into classes</a> or to show unfiltered "raw" data (assuming your data aren't already classed for you, in which case, the decision is moot).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example Map</strong><br>
			This is a 5-class x 5-class bivariate graduated symbol map that uses <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=classification" target="_blank">natural breaks classification</a> method and <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=color_schemes" target="_blank">sequential color scheme</a>. In the control panel below, you can see these fill colors applied to the data distribution histogram which tell us, for example, that on this map the darkest blue is used for only one observation, the outlier of California. The lightest blue has the most observations (states) as seen on both the map and the histogram. LIke all of the bivariate maps in indiemapper, you can mix-and-match <a href="http://indiemapper.com/app/learnmore.php?l=classification" target="_blank">classification methods</a> and number of classes, or even classed and unclassed approaches on the same maps (e.g., the colors can be unclassed, this size classed).

			Feel free to adjust the size of the symbols, the colors, the number of classes, the stroke, the size and color of the stroke, and the transparency of the fill color. Note that dropping the transparency will make it easier to see the underlying basemap, but will also change the fill colors, which become hard to discern as they become fainter (we recommend at least 80% opacity).

			You can also manually move the symbols around, which is helpful in areas of congestion.
